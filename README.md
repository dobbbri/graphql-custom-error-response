# Step by step

[Check this post to try it step by step](https://medium.com/@estrada9166/return-custom-errors-with-status-code-on-graphql-45fca360852)

# How to run it
+ Clone this repo.
+ `npm install`.
+ `npm run dev`.
+ Visit on your browser `http://localhost:7000/graphql`.
+ Make this query:
    ```
    {
      test {
        test
      }
    } 
    ```

## Main idea
The main idea is to return a custom error with the `statusCode` on the response, also you can send any extra field, to do it you need to change just 2 files:

### Constants.js
```js
exports.errorType = {
  UNAUTHORIZED: {
    message: 'Authentication is needed to get requested response.',
    statusCode: 401
    // add here any extra field
  }
}
```
### App.js
```js
formatError: (err) => {
  const error = getErrorCode(err.message)
  return ({ 
    message: error.message, 
    statusCode: error.statusCode 
    // add here err.<YOUR_EXTRA_FIELD_CREATED_ON_CONSTANTS>
  })
}
```

In this case we just want to return a `message` and a `statusCode`
